# Repository made for discord ~ example/personal throwback...

Here are some of my initial projects. So literally the projects I worked on while I was learning about design and code. It wasn't very recent, but it can certainly serve as an example, that is, some of my personal throwback.

P.S. ~ jelen.png was too big .psd file so I converted it to a picture (.png), but if anyone is interested, I can definitely send that .psd file too to you. Contact me by a mail. My e-mail address is on the home screen of my profile.
